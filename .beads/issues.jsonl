Different arrays may be extracted from different nodes in the graph.  The stream of arrays from each computation graph node are generally synchronized such that index=0 from node A and index=0 from node B represent the same unerlying 'event' but with the information processed in different ways.  We call these different representations 'DATA TIERS' or just 'tiers'.  To debug nodes and understand the underlying information we want to plot different tiers in ways that can be combined or compared.  We already have the start of this in the case that one array has a 3rd dimension and we may select which 'layer' to display.  We want to extend this initial idea in many ways.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"brett.viren@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T09:11:26.652730515-05:00","created_by":"Brett Viren","updated_at":"2026-01-19T09:11:26.652730515-05:00"}

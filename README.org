#+title: teepeesee - a display of Wire-Cell frame files

This was written by me and Gemini with the help of aider in about three hours during a sleepless night.

Usage:

#+begin_example
$ uv tool install git+https://github.com/brettviren/teepeesee
$ teepeesee display frame-file.npz
#+end_example

Zoom, select color scale, apply data transforms.

Maybe future:

- [ ] Navigate to different frames.
- [ ] Figure out better GUI controls.
- [ ] Save / restore zoom / pick state.

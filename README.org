#+title: teepeesee - a display of Wire-Cell frame files

This provides some display GUIs for LArTPC images as written by Wire-Cell
Toolkit.

Usage:

#+begin_example
$ uv tool install git+https://github.com/brettviren/teepeesee
$ teepeesee display frame-file.npz
$ cueteepeesee frame-file.npz [...]
#+end_example

Zoom, select color scale, apply data transforms.

The initial display was based on Matplotlib.

It is a bit slow and the GUI was rudimentary so a Qt based one was made with more UI features, better zooming, a lot faster for some thing (but still slower than I'd like for others).  It also adds multi-file event navigation and includes a "no file" random demo data.

Possible future improvements:

- [ ] Save / restore zoom / pick state.
- [ ] Refactor to reduce signal/slot spaghetti.
- [ ] Handle different data tiers in input.
  - [ ] Set "tag(s)" for selecting input.
  - [ ] Show multiple frames simultaneously
    - 1D plots is no problem
    - COLZ + BOX for image?
- [ ] File loader for FR data
- [ ] Auto reload if file changes.
